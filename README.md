# Sports Store: A Real Application

## Description

The `SportsStore*` application is the classic approach taken by online stores everywhere.

## Application Features

As a result of completing this task, you will receive an application that implements the following features:
- an online product catalog that customers can browse by category and page;
- a shopping cart where users can add and remove products;
- a checkout where customers can enter delivery details;
- an administration area that includes create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) tools for manage directory;

## .NET Platform
The task uses the .NET Core CLI command line tool and references applications that target .NET 6.

Visual Studio 2022 is the most convenient tool to get the task done, however, if your work machine is not configured to run this IDE, development can be done with Visual Studio Code and the .NET Core SDK (or ather IDE).

## Branching

The task consists of four steps. The description of the each step of the task are in the corresponding `step-k.md` file in the branch `sports-store-application-k`.

| # | Feature Branch Name | Step Description |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| 1 | sports-store-application-1 | step-1.md |
| 2 | sports-store-application-2 | step-2.md |
| 3 | sports-store-application-3 | step-3.md |
| 4 | sports-store-application-4 | step-4.md |

This task uses the following branching model:
- The `main` branch always contains workable code that should compile without errors or warnings. All requirements of the current step must be fulfilled.
- The feature branch is where most of the work for the current step takes place. Changes in a commit may contain warnings, but should not contain errors. Changes that belong to one task or are logically complete are recommended to be uploaded as a separate commit.
