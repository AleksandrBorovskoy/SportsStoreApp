# Sports Store: A Real Application

## Description

The `SportsStore*` application is the classic approach taken by online stores everywhere.

## Application Features

- an online product catalog that customers can browse by category and page;
- a shopping cart where users can add and remove products;
- a checkout where customers can enter delivery details;
- an administration area that includes create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) tools for manage directory;
- a secure application so that only administrators who are logged in can make changes.

## .NET Platform

Visual Studio 2022 is the most convenient tool to get the task done, however, if your work machine is not configured to run the IDE, development can be done with Visual Studio Code and the .NET Core SDK.
